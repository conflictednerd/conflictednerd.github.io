I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). I am broadly interested in sequential decision-making problems. I actively look for sources of inspiration in adjacent fields like generative modeling and quality-diversity optimization and explore various applications to open-ended learning, multi-agent systems, and meta-learning.

I am advised by Prof. [Stefanos Nikolaidis](https://stefanosnikolaidis.net/) and am part of the [ICAROS](https://icaros.usc.edu/) lab at USC.

Prior to starting my PhD, I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.ir/), Iran.

**Research Interests:**
- Reinforcement Learning
- Quality-Diversity Optimization
- Generative Modeling
- Open-ended Learning

Outside of research, I enjoy reading of all sorts, from philosophy to psychoanalysis to physics! I'm also an amateur cinephile, check out my [letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/conflictednerd/)!
