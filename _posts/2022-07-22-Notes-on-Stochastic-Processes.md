My handwritten notes/summaries for an undergraduate stochastic processes course that I took in can be found [HERE](https://github.com/conflictednerd/research/tree/main/University%20Courses/Stochastic%20Processes). 

I went through a lot of books, but I didn't like the order in which they introduced different topics. These notes are organized in a way that I thought was most intuitive and logical. So if you can read them (and that's a big ifðŸ˜Š) you shouldn't have any problem following the arguments and the chain of thought.

Below you can find a rough outline of the syllabus. **My notes cover the first half of the course**, up until the end of the branching process section.

**Errata:** In my notes for the first chapter, I sometimes misused "recursive state" when in fact I should have said "recurrent state".

### Syllabus

1. **Discrete Time Markov Chains**
   1. Finite State Space
   2. Return Time
   3. Countable State Space
   4. Mixing Time
2. **Continuous Time Markov Chains**
   1. Exponential and Poisson Distributions
   2. Poisson Process
   3. Continuous Time Markov Chains
3. **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)**
   1. Detailed Balance Equation
   2. Metropolis Algorithm
   3. Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm
   4. Glauber Dynamics (Gibbs Sampler)
4. **Probabilistic Models**
   1. Branching Process
   2. Random Graphs
   3. Percolation
   4. Uniform Spanning Tree
